### Description

This is a desktop application developed in Python using the PyQt framework to simulate the principles of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The application allows users to interact with a graphical user interface (GUI) to feel like its a real MRI machine.

The application has 3 main parts:

1. The first part is the **Phantom Viewer** which allows the user to view the MRI phantom in different formats. The user can click on any pixel in the phantom to see the values of its features like T1, T2, PD. The user also can change the brightness of the phantom using mouse scrolling wheel (Up for increaing brightness).

2. The second part is the **MRI Sequence Viewer** which allows the user to upload any MRI sequence written in json file and plot it. The user can also change the sequence parameters and update the sequene.

3. The third part is the **MRI Image Viewer** that shows the constructed MRI image from the uploaded sequence on the phantom image. The user can change the phantom size to see another image. The K-space image is also shown in the same window with real time plotting and progress bar.
